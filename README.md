This repository contains source code for the article, [STM32 Discovery Development on Linux](http://www.wolinlabs.com/blog/linux.stm32.discovery.gcc.html)


Contents:

1. LED blinker example (buildable)
2. STM libraries and headers
3. STM peripheral_examples (buildable)


STM libraries, headers, and examples have been modified to work with GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors toolchain and STM32F4 Discovery EVB.   Generally this just involved adding Makefiles and a slightly modified version of the TrueStudio linker file.
